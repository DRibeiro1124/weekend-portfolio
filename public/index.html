          into you? Have you been eating cheese? Hahahahah! A sea of waiters and no one will take a drink order. And although
          the intervention didn't work, it turned into one of the Bluth family's better parties. Everything they do is so
          dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire. God knows they're squinters. I made a huge
          tiny mistake. I'm sure Egg is a great person.</span>
